# Unity - Space Game
A good starter Unity project, that has the player control a space ship while he avoids randomly spawning astroids.

### Unity Game Features
* Spawning prefab astroids at random, and giving them random velocity, scale, and rotation.
* Controlling a spaceship sprite with the keyboard.
* Displaying user score with Textboxes
* Loading seperate scenes for a start screen and game screen
* Gameover screen and push to retry.
